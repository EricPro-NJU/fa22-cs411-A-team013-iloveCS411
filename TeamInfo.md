## Project Summary

I-Course Platform is a comprehensive system which combines the functionality of Course Explorer, Self-Service systems, Course Rating systems and Academic Performance Tracking systems. We aim to create a web application that allows students to manage their course schedule and professors to manage the course offerings they teach.

Both students and instructors need a simple and efficient way to manage courses. For students, a robust system is needed to make sure they can get into courses without any unnecessary stress. For instructors, they need to be able to easily manage a large number of class offerings they may teach in a semester. Our project aims to provide a solution to both issues: a simple and intuitive way for both students and teachers to access their courses.
